# Kour.io Exploits
A collection of exploits/bugs I've found during my time on [kour.io](https://kour.io/)
- Missing a lot, these are just some old funny ones :D

# Admin Panel
This could be used to set your KP values as KP is encrypted.
```js
unityInstance.SendMessage('MainManager', 'OnReceivedIsAdmin', "1")
```

# Finding Database Values
This is useful when trying to edit your account with their firebase DB
```js
db.ref('users').child("your_user_id").once('value')
  .then(function(snapshot) {
    snapshot.forEach(function(childSnapshot) {
      var childKey = childSnapshot.key;
      var childData = childSnapshot.val();
      console.log("Key: " + childKey + ", Data: ", childData);
    });
  })
  .catch(function(error) {
    console.error("Error fetching data: ", error);
  });
```

# Updating Public Database Values
Like level, etc...
```js
var test = db.ref('users').child("your_user_id").child("public");

test.update({ "totalScore": 1000000, "accountCreateDate": "Feburary 15th, 2000", "totalKills": "28451244", "totalHeadshots": "28451244", "totalDeaths": "0", "profileURL": "https://i.imgur.com/Y6KdFJ1.png", "primaryKills": "267472424", "playtime": "28246714", "maxKillStreak": "274172424", "elo": "27242424", "chickenKills": "14571245", "barrels": "181383" })
  .then(function() {
    console.log("updated successfully");
  })
  .catch(function(error) {
    console.error("Error updating: ", error);
  });
```

# Extra-long usernames breaking invite render

# Invite Spamming
There was no ratelimit on invites so you were able to send invites (from anybody) at any speed, it'd then cover 30% of their screen.

# Breaking out of the clan color var
```js
create_Clan("test", "example_id", "ff0000>d<color=#ffc800>r<color=#5eff00>o<color=#00ffb3>p<color=#00d9ff>o<color=#0022ff>u<color=#ff00f7>t<color=#ffffff>")
```

# Give any skin in the game
This was sent across the WS, but can be edited using the method used earlier.
This was used to get the un-released dye.
```js
{"t":"d","d":{"r":16,"a":"m","b":{"p":"/users/user_id","d":{"ownedCustomSkin19":"69"}}}}
```

# Clan Takeover
You could set yourself to be in any clan by changing the public value `clan` to your target then updating its `owner_id` to be your own.

# Invisibility/Godmode Exploit
Basically you just need to freeze the memory address for my player health, then go to a barrel and shoot it therefor tricking the server to thinking im dead while client side still alive.
You'd still be able to kill people without being visible on their screen.

# Developer Panel Found

# Memory Editing (big issue)
You are able to edit shop prices on items to negative values like -1000000 then buy them and you'd be credited +1000000, this was also doable for your score/kills/deaths/etc in-game.
